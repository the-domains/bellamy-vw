T25 adventures ahead

12 months ago as a wedding gift, we took a VW T2 Campervan (a pink one, like the one to the right of us!) for a 4 day spin. It was a really amazing few days that got us thinking about owning a campervan ourselves. So, 12 months later (almost to the day) we have purchased a T25 (or T3 if you prefer) VW campervan. We can't wait to collect it in the next couple of weeks.
