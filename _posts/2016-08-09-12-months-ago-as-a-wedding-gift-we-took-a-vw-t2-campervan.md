  12 months ago as a wedding gift, we took a VW T2 Campervan (a pink one, like
  the one to the right of us!) for a 4 day spin. It was a really amazing few
  days that got us thinking about owning a campervan ourselves. So, 12 months
  later (almost to the day) we have purchased a T25 (or T3 if you prefer) VW
  campervan. We canâ€™t wait to collect it in the next couple of weeks.
